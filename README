You have captured the boy king, but now must escape through the wooods.
Rumour has it there's a HERO about.

== Installation ==

You will need ghc and cabal-install to build this from source.  On Debian you can get these with:

	sudo apt-get install ghc cabal-install

On windows you can get them by installing the Haskell Platform from <http://haskell.org>.

You will also need SDL and related libraries.  On Debian you can get these with:

	sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

Then run the following command:

	cabal install containers errors elerea elerea-sdl SDL SDL-image SDL-ttf SDL-mixer data-lens basic-prelude random utility-ht text

and then finally the normal:

	make

You can run the game by running:

	dist/build/LudumDare25/LudumDare25

(Note that the executable *MUST* by run while you are in the folder with the assets.)
